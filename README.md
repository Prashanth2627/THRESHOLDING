# THRESHOLDING

## Aim:
To segment the image using global thresholding, adaptive thresholding and Otsu's thresholding using python and OpenCV.

## Software Required:

Anaconda - Python 3.7
OpenCV

## Algorithm:

### Step1:
Load the necessary packages.

### Step2:
Read the Image and convert to grayscale.

### Step3:
Use Global thresholding to segment the image.

### Step4:
Use Adaptive thresholding to segment the image.

Step5:
Use Otsu's method to segment the image and display the results.
